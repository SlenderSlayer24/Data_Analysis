# Overview

As an Anime fan. I love finding new shows and things to watch. Sometimes though, you get reccomendations that aren't that good or turn out worse then what the person said. So I decided that I would use my sofware engineering skills to help make my own reconmendations. Seeing what is the highest rated, and even anwsering some other questions and things that I have about anime that I just genrally found intresting. 

The set of data I'm using is an anime related data set from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/CooperUnion/anime-recommendations-database) It contains info on most any anime, including title, genre, rating, series type, and episode number. 

The first program, (Anime_rating.py) anwsers the main questions. 1 What is the highest rated anime series of all time. 2. What are the highest rated anime movie/tv series. and, it can even help one find the ratings of individual animes. The other two programs (Genre.py and Episode_Number.py) Ask individual questions using the same data base. With Episode_Number.py finding the avrage number of episodes across all anime Tv series. And Genre.py finds the number of animes with a certain kind of genre tied to it.

# Development Environment

To develoup this software, I used Virtual Studio Code for the text editer and to setup the programs. The data was premade in csv and I created the programs through python and it's pandas data managment modual.

* [W3 Schools Tutorial on using Pandas to read CSV files](https://www.w3schools.com/python/pandas/pandas_csv.asp)

# Future Work

* Item 1: Connect the three programs together in a more comprehensive, singular program.
* Item 2: Less specific search options
* Item 3: Searching ratings by Genres.
